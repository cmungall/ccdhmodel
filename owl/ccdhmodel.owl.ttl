We interpret the growth_rate and passage_number properties in the ADM as describing features of the a cell line/culture, tissue culture, or organoid  that is either the source of a specimen, or a product that a specimen is derived into.   But because this is a "living" biological entity, we do not consider it to be a specimen itself. For this reason, we define a BiologicallyDerivedProduct class from which to hang these properties. This is a simple placeholder class with a few basic fields that will be fleshed out if/when the need arises.""" .

Consider whether this represents the entire creation process, or a single activity involved in the creation process.  I think in FHIR the 'collection' backbone element represents the entire process (as it has 0..1 cardinality). But I think that the 'processing' backbone element may represent just one of many possible processing activities (as it has a 0..m cardinality).  The cardinality on the 'method' fileds in these two activity classes (and Storage) will also depend on our decision here. 

Consider also if this is scoped to creation of a single specimen - i.e. would a 'sectioning activity' that produced 10 slices be considered one or ten SpecimenCreationActivities? It matters for what data we capture in this entity (e.g. quantity collected, and relative order can go here only if it is scoped to a single specimen). Note that if we split creation into collection and derivation, the anwer may be different for these two activity types. 

MHB: for define just a single concrete SpecimenCreationActivity class.  Later we can split the two classes into SpecimenCollection and SpecimenDerivation - if we decide to go this route. """ .

SE: same thought as above but probably too much change to consider for this cycle. This field and similar ones are really not an attribute of a single entity. It's a "relational fact" that involves multiple entity instances and the fact itself holds some attributes. Saying this in plain English makes this clear. For example, this can be worded as "Study x uses specimen y and uses specimen z as a reference". So one option is to figure out how to reduce this to a simple property and this is doable if we put more meaning on the instance of x and y. If we say that we'll have an instance of y for every study the real thing behind y (the real world specimen), i.e. y stands for the role of the real specimen in the specific study, then we can have a simle property on that instance to say it is a reference because that property is specific to y's role in that study, not the real y entity in the world. We haven't talked much about the meaning of the instances of our entities, i.e. when should they be instantiated and what does the instance stand for in the data, so it's hard to decide on how to model attriburtes.
