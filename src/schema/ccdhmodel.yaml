        - 'MHB: Thoughts on whether I accurately summarized the relevant aspects of
          FHIR identifier fields/data types, and whether it is prudent for us to propose
          adopting these at this point?  Happy to take a different direction if others
          feel strongly, or consider alternate names for these attributes (e.g. ''internal_id''
          vs  ''external_id'')


          BTF: well, i find ''id'' and ''identifier'' difficult to distinguish without
          knowing the FHIR definitions of these.  certainly ''internal_id'' or ''logical_id''
          and ''external_id'' or ''business_id'' make a clearer distinction between
          the meaning of these fields.  that said, i am fine sticking with FHIR-aligned
          attributes here unless others object


          SE: the "id" is really implementation dependent thing. In REST/FHIR it''s
          the resoruce identifier, in Java there is no such thing since it''s a memory

          tissue sample vs. a tumor aspirate vs. a blood sample. We will probably
          deliberately change sample_type to physical_sample_type to clarify this."


          SE: for later consideration, if there are enough properties about the source
          of a specimen, we should probably consider modeling a "Source" entity, which
          can just be an instance of "BiologicalEntity" with properties but there.
